# [Machine-Learning-App] (https://github.com/toplaa/Machine-Learning-App)

A machine learning app (main.py) is created using streamlit hosted on your local machine. 
This App integrates the common Machine Learning datasets "Iris", "Breast cancer" and "Wine dataset" which can be explored by different Machine learning model classifiers. Some major parameters are included in the App which can be modified from the front end in order to view the effect on the model accuracy.
Finally, It also includes a dimensionality reduction of features using Principal Component Analysis and displays the result in a graphical manner.

Further comments are included within the code for more clarifications

Useful commands:
pip install streamlit --> to install
streamlit run main.py --> to run file from the terminal. file name here is main.py
